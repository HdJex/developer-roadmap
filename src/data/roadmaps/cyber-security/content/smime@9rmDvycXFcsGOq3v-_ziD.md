# S/MIME

**S/MIME** stands for Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, and it is a cryptographic protocol that enhances the security of business emails through encryption and digital signatures. It allows users to encrypt emails and digitally sign them to verify the sender’s identity.

## Advantages of S/MIME

- **Verification**: Confirms the sender’s identity.

- **Confidentiality**: Protects the content from unauthorized access.

- **Integrity**: Ensures the message has not been altered.

- **Secure Data Transfer**: Safely transmits files like images, audio, videos, and documents.

- **Non-repudiation**: Prevents the sender from denying the origin of the message.

## How S/MIME Works

S/MIME enables the transmission of non-ASCII data via the Secure Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). It securely sends various data files, including music, video, and images, using encryption. Data encrypted with a public key can only be decrypted by the recipient’s private key, ensuring secure end-to-end communication.
