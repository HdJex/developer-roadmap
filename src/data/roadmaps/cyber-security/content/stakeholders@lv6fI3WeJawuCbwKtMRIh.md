# Stakeholders

Stakeholders are individuals or organizations with a right, share, claim, or interest in a system or its characteristics that meet their needs and expectations.

### External Stakeholders:

- Government agencies
- Policy regulators
- Partners
- Suppliers

### Internal Stakeholders:

- Subject matter experts
- Legal
- Compliance
- Senior management

Stakeholders vary based on the organization, making their identification essential. They must be notified according to the organization's playbook for escalating problems and providing updates. Not all stakeholders are equal, some may require a less technical report highlighting the main points, while others will need a full technical report.
