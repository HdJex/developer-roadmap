# Zero Day

A **zero-day** is the technique used by an attacker to infiltrate a system that has a vulnerability that is not publicly known. The term "zero day" signifies that the attack occurs before the target becomes aware of the existing vulnerability. In this scenario, the attacker deploys malware prior to the developer or vendor having the chance to issue a patch to rectify the flaw.
